DeeLite
=======

Whilst the full [Debrief] application brings a full workbench of tools to analysts, the DeeLite ("Debrief-Lite") application has been created for ad-hoc analysis/replay tasks by casual users.   There's a much more shallow learning curve, witin a user interface that is focussed on a smaller capability set:

* replay tracks
* pan/zoom around tracks
* replay of narrative data

The compiled DeeLite application is small to download (favouring deployed units), with few dependencies.

Here's a view of a loaded track:

To keep the distributable size down, by default the app is only distributed with a global coastline, though the framework is also able to show geo-referenced images (as used in [Debrief Charting] )
